    <h1>who?</h1>
    <p>
      Hi, I'm a freelance web / mobile developer with an interest on UI aesthetic.<br/>
      I'm based on Bandar Lampung, Indonesia.<br/>
      You can call me <strong>Thobi</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spent most of my time developing web / mobile apps using Javascript, especially React for FrontEnd and Node / Express for BackEnd.<br/>
      I started working as Front End Developer for Xtremax Pte. Ltd. on 2015 and resigned from the company on 2016. I've been freelancing since then.<br/>
      I spent my free time like an average Joe would (watching movies, playing games, etc).
