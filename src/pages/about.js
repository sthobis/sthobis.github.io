    <h1>HI!</h1>
    <p>I'm a freelance web/mobile developer with interest on UI design.</p>
    <p>I am based on Bandar Lampung, Indonesia. You can call me Thobi.</p>
    <p>I spent most of my time developing web/mobile apps using Javascript, especially React for FrontEnd and Node/Express for BackEnd.</p>
    <p>I started working as Front End Developer for Xtremax Pte. Ltd. on 2015 and resigned from the company on 2016. I've been freelancing since then.</p>
    <p>I spent my free time like an average Joe would (watching movies, playing games, etc).</p>
    <p><br/>You can find me on twitter @iBoht and instagram @sthobis</p>
